# Flappy Bird (Unity)

Flappy Bird is a mobile game originally developed by Dong Nguyen. This project is a Unity remake of the classic game where the player controls a bird trying to fly through pipes by tapping the screen.

## Game Description

The objective of the game is simple: help the bird navigate through the pipes without hitting them. The bird will fall due to gravity, and you must tap the screen to make it flap its wings and fly upwards.

### Features:
- **Simple Gameplay**: Tap to make the bird flap and avoid obstacles.
- **Endless Mode**: The game continues until the bird hits a pipe or the ground.
- **Score System**: Earn points for each set of pipes successfully passed.
